\section{Required software}

All of the software used in the project is Free and Open Source Software, and is freely available for many platforms, from the Internet. The underlying software required is given in the following table:\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l | p{5cm} | p{7cm}|}
\hline
Python 2.7 & The software was written in the Python programming modules, using Twython for Python 2.7. &Included in Ubuntu by default, easily obtained for other operating systems.\\ \hline

Sqlite3 & Sqlite3 was used to produce the databases. &This is included with Python by default.\\
\hline
Twython & The Twython module was used to obtain the data from the Twitter API. & This must be installed via the \emph{pip} package management system for python. Running \emph{sudo pip install twython} after installing \emph{pip} via your package manager should install the module.\\ \hline
NetworkX & The NetworkX module was used to produce the GML files. & NetworkX can be installed via the \emph{pip} package management system.\\ \hline
Gephi & Gephi was used to visualise the graphs (although other software could be used instead without any difficulty). & Gephi is available at \url{https://gephi.org/ }.\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\end{center}
\section{Database structure}
{\bf tweetsdb.db}:\\

The database file \emph{tweetsdb.db} contains the tables for the queries on \emph{\#climatechange}, \emph{\#climate}, \emph{\#globalwarming}, \emph{\#climaterealists},\emph{"Climate Change"}, \emph{"Global Warming"}, \emph{\#agw}.\\

Tables: \emph{htagw, htclimatechange, htglobalwarming, htclimate, ClimateChange, GlobalWarming, htclimaterealists}\\
Each table contains the tweets for that hashtag/query, all have the same structure.\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{l | l | p{13cm}} 
Id & INT & Unique ID number of the tweet. \\
ScreenName & TEXT & User name of the posting user. \\
FullName & TEXT & Full name of the user (if given). \\
Tweet & TEXT & Text of the tweet (sometimes truncated due to URLs, etc. added in) \\
Timestamp & TEXT & Timestamp of the tweet in the form:  "Mon Jun 17 22:38:21 +0000 2013" \\
RetweetCount & INT & Number of times this tweet has been retweeted.\\
InReplyToStatusId & INT & If this tweet is a reply to a status, returns the ID number of that status. \\
InReplyToUserId & INT & If this tweet is a reply, returns the ID of the user to whom the reply is.\\
Truncated & INT & Always returns 0. \\
Retweeted & INT & Always returns 0. \\
FriendsCount & INT & Returns the number of users that the tweeting user is following, at the time of collecting the data.\\
FollowersCount & INT & Returns the number of users that the are following the tweeting user, at the time of collecting the data.\ \\
IsRetweet & INT & Field added by myself. Boolean 1 or 0 - whether the tweet is a retweet or not by checking for presence of "RT: @X".\\
RetweetSource & TEXT & Field added by myself. Returns the username of the original source, if the tweet is a retweet, otherwise returns "-". \\
ConvertedTime & INT & Field added by myself. The timestamp converted to UNIX time. \\
RetweetTweet & TEXT & The text only of the Retweet (i.e. "RT: @X" removed) , if it is a retweet, otherwise "-".\\
\end{tabular}\\
\\

{\bf userdb.db}:\\

The user database \emph{userdb.db} contains a table of descriptions for many users, a table of followers for many users - where multiple records for the source user construct a list of followers, a table of friends structured the same way as for followers, a table mapping the user ID number to the screen name of the user.\\

Tables: \emph{descriptions, followers, friends, usermap}\\
\\
\emph{descriptions}:\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{l | l | p{13cm}} 
ScreenName & TEXT & The user name of the user.\\
Description & TEXT & The description of the user.\\
\end{tabular}\\
\\
\emph{followers}:\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{l | l | p{13cm}} 
ScreenName & TEXT & The user name of the user.\\
FollowerId & INT & The ID number of a follower of the user.\\
\end{tabular}\\
\\
\emph{friends}:\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{l | l | p{13cm}} 
ScreenName & TEXT & The user name of the user.\\
FriendId & INT & The ID number of a friend (i.e. other user whom the user is following) of the user.\\
\end{tabular}\\
\\
\emph{usermap}:\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{l | l | p{13cm}} 
ScreenName & TEXT & The user name of the user.\\
UserId & INT & The User ID number of the user.\\
\end{tabular}\\
\\

{\bf IPCCdb.db}:\\

The database file \emph{IPCCdb.db} contains the tables for the queries on the hashtags \emph{\#AR5}, \emph{\#HadCRUT}, \emph{\#LTFchat}, \emph{\#Pages2k},  \emph{\#WGII}, \emph{\#GISS}, \emph{\#IPCC}, \emph{\#Pages}, \emph{\#UNFCCC}, \emph{\#WGIII}\\

Tables: \emph{AR5, HadCRUT, LTFchat, Pages2k, WGII, GISS, IPCC, Pages, UNFCCC, WGIII}\\
Each table contains the tweets for that hashtag/query, all have the same structure. This is the same as for the \emph{tweetsdb.db} file, except with the additional field UserId which stores the User ID number of the posting user directly (this field was accidentally omitted in the construction of the other database).\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{l | l | p{13cm}} 
Id & INT & Unique ID number of the tweet. \\
ScreenName & TEXT & User name of the posting user. \\
UserId & INT & The User ID number of the posting user.\\
FullName & TEXT & Full name of the user (if given). \\
Tweet & TEXT & Text of the tweet (sometimes truncated due to URLs, etc. added in) \\
Timestamp & TEXT & Timestamp of the tweet in the form:  "Mon Jun 17 22:38:21 +0000 2013" \\
